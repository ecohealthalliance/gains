# Gains summaries


## Code
The summary statistics code is in iPython Notebook format. See Science Setup instructions on Github to get setup. There is an additional Python output should you have trouble setting up Notebook, but this will not be the main line of development and may get out of date (it is in the output folder)

## Data
- Surveys has raw csv files to ingest with iPython Notebook
- G_core_surveys has a combined csv

## Output
- Has a copy of the pdf output 
- Python version of iPython notebook
- HTML version of summary output
